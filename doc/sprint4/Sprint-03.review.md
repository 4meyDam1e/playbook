## **Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect**

- When: July 26
- Where: Online on Discord Voice Call

## **Process - Reflection**

### **Decisions that turned out well**

- **Decision 1**: Fragmentation of functionality: This helped in segmenting various tasks to different team members efficiently so that all the other stories in the same sprint did not rely on one story.
- **Decision 2**: More collaboration and communication among team members resulted in facilitated problem-solving.
- **Decision 3**: Finishing all the “main” parts of features, allowing us to add functionalities to these features in future sprints.

### **Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped**

- **Decision 1**: Although communication was decent, we could have definitely communicated more earlier on in the sprint.
- **Decision 2**: Even though we did try to merge code earlier, we still had tons of merge conflicts in the end of the sprint.
- **Decision 3**: We are not committing our code changes often enough which causes a headache in case we need to rollback. Instead of having the entire feature done in 1 commit we should split it up into smaller commits.

### **Planned changes**

- **Change 1**:  Communicate more - we will try to communicate and collaborate more when we are stuck.
- **Change 2**:  Merge code earlier so we have more leeway to fix any issues/merge conflicts.
- **Change 3**:  Commit changes more often since it provides a more consistent history of the project as well as allowing for easier rollbacks if any bugs or issues occur.

### **Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:**

- **Goal/Task 1**: View Profile: The delete account feature took a little longer than expected so the view profile feature has been pushed to sprint 4.

## **Meeting Highlights**

1. **********************************************************************Fragmentation of Features is Great:********************************************************************** We did a really good job in making sure that features do not rely on each other at all for this sprint and future sprints.
2. **************************************Commit More Often:************************************** Committing more often can only be a good thing as it makes it easier to view progress and roll back
3. ******************************************Communication is Key:****************************************** Our communication has certainly improved as a team, but it can always be better.
4. ********************************************Merge Early and Often:******************************************** Merging early and often reduces the merge conflicts when we eventually create a PR, reducing the possibility of more bugs being created
5. **********************Time Management:********************** Starting the sprint earlier gave us more room to fix any unexpected errors or conflicts along the way.
